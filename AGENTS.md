# AGENTS.md

Context for AI coding assistants (and humans) working in this repo. Read this
before making changes. It follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md) convention
and is also useful as Claude Code / Cursor project context.

## What this repo is

The Python reference of the Tyto acoustics-aware voice-agent demo. A live voice
agent talks to the user while the ai-coustics **Tyto** model scores the user's
microphone in real time, and the agent adapts on three layers (Aware, Tuned,
Reactive). The canonical browser reference is [index.html](index.html); this
branch reproduces the same behavior server-side in Python. Keep the two
comparable.

Tyto returns, per fixed 5 second window: a **risk_score** (0..1, higher is
worse) and six dimensions (`noise`, `speaker_reverb`, `speaker_loudness`,
`interfering_speech`, `packet_loss`, `codec_degradation`).

The current model is **Tyto 1.1** (`tyto-1.1-l-16khz`, model version 7), which
needs aic-sdk 3.x on the Python side and `@ai-coustics/aic-sdk-wasm` 0.23.x in
the browser. Coming from Tyto 1.0: the old `media_speech` dimension is folded
into `interfering_speech` (competing speech, live or from a device),
`codec_degradation` is new, and the risk score is recalibrated, so the docs'
bands moved to <0.30 good / 0.30-0.50 warn / >0.50 bad.

## Architecture and data flow

```

- **scorer.py** owns the SDK analyzer and the audio buffering. It does not own
  the mic; callers push audio via `feed()`.
- **controller.py** is the brain. It is provider-agnostic and holds the
  mute/nudge state machine. It runs on two threads (scores arrive on the scorer
  thread, provider events on the transport thread), guarded by one re-entrant
  lock.
- **provider.py** is the seam. **openai_realtime.py** is the only file that
  knows about a specific backend. Audio playback is delegated to callbacks
  (`audio_out` / `audio_done` / `audio_flush`), so the same provider drives a
  local speaker or a browser.
- **audio.py** is `SounddeviceSink`, the local-speaker player for the terminal
  agent. It also owns the "is the agent audible" signal (`on_agent_audio`).
- **decision.py** is the pure scoring contract and decision functions, shared
  and identical across branches.

### Frontends

- **examples/score_mic.py** - terminal mic scorer (no agent).
- **examples/voice_agent.py** - terminal agent; uses `SounddeviceSink`.
- **examples/web/** - the browser UI. `server.py` (aiohttp) is the whole brain
  per tab; the browser is a thin client. `index.html` is generated from the root
  reference (CSS + markup reused, BYOK gate removed); `app.js` is the transport
  (mic capture, agent playback, render). Audio is relayed browser <-> backend
  <-> OpenAI; keys stay in the server env. The player (browser) owns
  `on_agent_audio`, reported back over the socket.

### Who owns "agent audible" (on_agent_audio)

The component that plays the audio reports it: `SounddeviceSink` in the terminal,
the browser in the web demo. The provider never calls `on_agent_audio`; it only
reports generation lifecycle via `on_agent_speaking`. Keep this split when adding
a backend.

## The provider seam: adding a new voice backend

This is the main extension point. To add ElevenLabs, LiveKit, a cascaded
pipeline, etc., write one subclass of `VoiceProvider` (see
[src/tyto_voice/provider.py](src/tyto_voice/provider.py)) and nothing else changes.

1. Implement the commands: `connect`, `disconnect`, `set_instructions` (Aware),
   `set_turn_detection` (Tuned and the listen gate), `set_mic_enabled`,
   `interrupt`, `nudge` (Reactive), `request_response`, `send_tool_result`.
2. Drive the controller from the backend's events through a `Handlers` object:
   `on_ready`, `on_agent_speaking(active, nudge, cancelled)`,
   `on_user_transcript`, `on_agent_transcript`, `on_tool_call`. Call
   `controller.on_agent_audio(playing)` from whatever plays the audio, not the
   provider (see below).
3. Wire it like [examples/voice_agent.py](examples/voice_agent.py) (terminal) or
   [examples/web/server.py](examples/web/server.py) (browser).

If a backend cannot support a layer (for example it manages turn-taking itself),
do not fake it. Implement what you can and document the gap in the README.

## Invariants to preserve

These keep the demo correct and comparable across branches. Do not change them
casually.

- **Tuned constants are ground truth.** Window 5 s, hop ~2 s, EMA alpha 0.3
  (the value the Tyto docs recommend), the per-dimension thresholds, the nudge
  bands. They live in `decision.py` and match the browser byte for byte. If you
  change one, change it in every branch and say why.
- **Warm-up gate.** Never score until a full fresh 5 s window has been buffered
  since the last reset. On resume after the agent speaks, reset the analyzer and
  re-warm. Stale audio must never skew a reading.
- **Mute and pause while the agent speaks.** The mic is muted (no frames sent to
  the agent) and scoring is paused while the agent talks; both resume after.
- **A nudge always needs a cause the user can act on.** A high risk_score alone
  never nudges; one dimension must dominate (`strongest_cause`), and it must be
  one with nudge text. `codec_degradation` deliberately has none: it is a
  transport problem, so it feeds the Aware note (confirm names and numbers) but
  is never spoken at the user.
- **`speaker_loudness` and `speaker_reverb` are informational only.** Never
  colored as a problem, never named as a cause, never the reason for a nudge.

## aic-sdk quick reference (verified against aic-sdk 3.1.0, core 0.23.0)

```python
import aic_sdk as aic
path = aic.Model.download("tyto-1.1-l-16khz", "./models")  # CDN, cached
model = aic.Model.from_file(path)
# streaming (live):
collector, analyzer = aic.analyzer_pair(model, license_key)
config = aic.ProcessorConfig.optimal(model, sample_rate=24000)
collector.initialize(config)
collector.buffer(np.zeros(config.block_size, dtype=np.float32))  # 1D mono, exact block_size
result = analyzer.analyze_buffered()   # rolling window; silence-padded if short
analyzer.reset()                       # clears analyzer AND collector
# result fields: risk_score, noise, speaker_reverb, speaker_loudness,
#                interfering_speech, packet_loss, codec_degradation
```

What changed from the 2.x API this repo used before (all of it applies here):
`num_frames` -> `block_size`, `ProcessorConfig` has no `num_channels` and
buffers are 1D mono, `media_speech` -> `codec_degradation`,
`get_optimal_num_frames` -> `get_optimal_block_size`, and the analyzer gained
`terminate_session()`. Model ids are dotted (`tyto-1.1-l-16khz`) even though the
CDN path is dashed.

This demo is real-time only. (`aic.FileAnalyzer(model, key).analyze(...)` exists
for offline batch scoring, but it is intentionally not part of this demo.)

`Model.download`, `ProcessorConfig.optimal(..., sample_rate=24000)` and the
`AnalysisResult` field names are confirmed against the installed package; only
the licensed analysis steps need a real key.

## OpenAI Realtime event mapping (WebSocket, server-side)

Model: `gpt-realtime-2.1` (both stacks). Input transcription stays on
`gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`; `gpt-live-transcribe` is the newer option if you want
it.

| Concept | Outgoing / incoming |
| --- | --- |
| configure session | `session.update` (instructions, audio.input.turn_detection, transcription, audio.output.voice, tools) |
| send mic | `input_audio_buffer.append` (base64 PCM16, 24 kHz) |
| agent audio | `response.output_audio.delta` (also legacy `response.audio.delta`) |
| agent text | `response.output_audio_transcript.delta` / `.done` |
| user text | `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta` / `.completed` |
| tool call | `response.function_call_arguments.done` |
| nudge | `response.create` with `metadata.tyto_purpose = "nudge"` |
| interrupt | `response.cancel` (and clear the local playback buffer) |

## Running and verifying

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv run pytest -q                 # 34 tests: decision layer + controller + scorer
```

The unit tests need no SDK, key, or hardware. The end-to-end audio path needs an
ai-coustics key, an OpenAI key, a mic, and headphones.

## Conventions

- Style: KISS and DRY, clean and minimal. Match the surrounding code.
- No em dashes in prose or comments. Use hyphens or rewrite.
- Secure context: the mic needs HTTPS or localhost in any browser-facing
  extension of this.
- Verify provider APIs against current docs; they change often. Do not trust
  training memory for method or event names.

## Related ai-coustics tooling

If your assistant has the ai-coustics MCP skills available, these help when
working with audio in this repo: `tyto` (score audio with the observability
model), `enhance` (run SDK enhancement), `transcribe` (STT across providers),
and `before-after` (comparison pages). They are separate tools from this demo
but share the same model family and license.
